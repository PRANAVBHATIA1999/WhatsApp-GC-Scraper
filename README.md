## Enhancements
Please feel free to message me or open an issue if you have an idea for an enhancement. Seems like people are starting to use this and I would like to improve it further.

# Future Prospects 
I have started working on the bot to send messgaes indivisually to your desired contacts, It is working preety good for now but I see a few bugs here and there. 
### (I have already executed it and I managed to send a message to over 100 saved/unsaved contacts.)
